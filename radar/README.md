# Demo of an arduino with HCSR04 sensor

This program shows a demonstration of a radar using an ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04  . The ultrasonic sensor will send out a signal and listen for its echo, which is used to measure the distance from the sensor to any nearby objects. If an object is detected, the radar will indicate this by lighting up a circle on the screen that corresponds to the objectâ€™s location. 

This can help users detect obstacles that may be in their path or potential dangers like an approaching vehicle.
